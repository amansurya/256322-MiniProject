COST AND FEATURES:
Cost of a management system is very minimal. But to implement this in real life , a database has to be maintained that consists of account details of numerous number of customers. Making this accessible to anyone from anywhere requires high setup which increases the cost. Features  of this ATM management system includes cash withdraw, money transfer from one account to another, changing the personal identification number, balance enquiry etc. This ATM management system does not involve any external devises such as reading a physical card etc, rather goes for a transaction using account number and PIN. If we want to implement this feature then cost increases for adding external devices.
